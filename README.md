### Goal
>  Create a quine : a kind of metaprogram whose output and source code are identical.

### Forbidden
* opening the source file and displaying it
* use of any data entry
* trivial solution empty


### Rules

#### Names
* [ ] Executable = *
#### Needs 
* [ ] A main function  
* [ ] One comment in the main function
* [ ] One comment outside the program

You can validate this project with the C part only, however we strongly invite you to
realize the Assembly part for all the next projects in this branch.
The first program must have the features below :
• The executable must be named Colleen.
• When executed, the program must display on the standard output an output identical to the source code of the file used to compile the program.
• The source code must contain at least :
◦ A main function.
◦ Two different comments.
◦ One of the comments must be present in the main function
◦ One of the comments must be present outside of your program.
◦ Another function in addition to the main function (which of course will be
called)
