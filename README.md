## Goal
> Create 3  `Quines` : a kind of metaprogram whose output and source code are identical.

## Forbidden
* Opening the source file and displaying it
* Use of any data entry
* Trivial solution empty


## Rules for the 3 programs
    
### Colleen
* [ ] Display on the `standard output`

- [ ] A main function  
- [ ] Another function that will be call
- [ ] One comment in the main function and one outside the program


### Grace
* [ ] Writes in a file  `Grace_kid.c/Grace_kid.s`


- [ ] No main
- [ ] Three defines only
- [ ] Run by calling a macro.

### Sully

 * [ ] Create/Compile/Run a file  `Sully_X.c/Sully_X.s`  ( X an integer given in the source code )


- [ ] Stops when X = 0
- [ ] X decrements by one at each creation
- [ ] X starts at 5

## Takeaway

```C
int main (void)
{
}
```
